:::

This project was created as part of a school course and serves as a demonstration of acoustic levitation using ultrasonic waves.

It is the first functional prototype (mk1), aimed at verifying the principle of levitating light objects (e.g., polystyrene beads) using a standing acoustic field. If i feel like it, I'll build a mk2.

## What the project includes

- 3D printed levitator structure
- Ultrasonic transmitter arrays (~40 kHz)
- Simple control electronics
- Basic demonstration of particle levitation

## Project status

> [!WARNING]
> **Prototype / Demonstration Project**
>
> - Not optimized for stability or performance
> - Not intended for practical use
> - Serves primarily for education and demonstration of physical principles

## Inspiration

- TinyLev – open-source acoustic levitator ([instructables.com][tinylev])
